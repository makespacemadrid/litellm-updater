# AGENTS.md

This repository includes instructions for AI coding assistants.

- Claude Code users should read `CLAUDE.md` for project guidance and workflow notes.
- Other agents should follow the same practices outlined there unless a tool-specific guide is added later.
- When making changes, bump the project version (pyproject + __version__ files) and include the new version tag in CI image builds automatically.
